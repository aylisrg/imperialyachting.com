    question: "What is the difference between a yacht charter and a boat rental in Dubai?",
    answer:
      "A yacht charter in Dubai typically refers to a fully crewed, all-inclusive experience aboard a luxury motor yacht.

A 'boat rental' often implies a self-drive or bareboat arrangement, which requires an operator's licence and is less common for luxury vessels in Dubai. Imperial Yachting provides crewed charters only, ensuring guests enjoy a premium, stress-free experience.",
